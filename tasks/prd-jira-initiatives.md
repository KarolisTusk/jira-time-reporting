# Product Requirements Document: JIRA Initiatives Feature

## Introduction/Overview

The JIRA Initiatives feature addresses the need for client-specific worklog reporting in scenarios where tasks for multiple client projects are being logged under a single JIRA project. This feature enables flexible grouping of work across projects, labels, and epics to provide accurate client billing and transparent reporting.

The system will allow administrators to create initiatives that combine multiple projects and labels (e.g., "SO Initiative" includes EC project with "SO" label + OD project with "x" label), providing clients with clear visibility into their dedicated development time and costs.

## Goals

1. **Enable Client-Specific Reporting**: Provide clients with accurate, transparent reporting of development time dedicated to their initiatives
2. **Flexible Work Grouping**: Allow administrators to create initiatives that span multiple projects, labels, and epics
3. **Cost Transparency**: Display development costs to clients based on configurable hourly rates
4. **Access Control**: Ensure clients only see their assigned initiatives while allowing internal managers broader access
5. **Historical Data Integration**: Include all relevant historical worklog data in initiative reporting
6. **Export Capabilities**: Provide detailed Excel exports for client billing and reporting

## User Stories

### Client Users
- **As a client user**, I want to view my initiative's monthly development hours so that I can track resource allocation
- **As a client user**, I want to see the total development cost for my initiative so that I can manage my budget
- **As a client user**, I want to export detailed reports to Excel so that I can share progress with my stakeholders
- **As a client user**, I want to see which specific issues contributed to my initiative so that I understand what work was completed

### Internal Team Managers
- **As an internal manager**, I want to analyze time allocation across all initiatives so that I can optimize resource planning
- **As an internal manager**, I want to view cross-initiative analytics so that I can identify resource conflicts or opportunities
- **As an internal manager**, I want to access any initiative data so that I can support client inquiries

### System Administrators
- **As a system admin**, I want to create and configure initiatives with flexible project/label combinations so that I can accurately group client work
- **As a system admin**, I want to assign initiative access to users so that I can control data visibility
- **As a system admin**, I want to set hourly development rates per initiative so that clients see accurate cost information
- **As a system admin**, I want to modify existing initiatives so that I can adapt to changing client requirements

## Functional Requirements

### Data Import & Synchronization
1. The system must extend JIRA import to capture issue labels and epic information
2. The system must include historical worklog data when creating new initiatives
3. The system must sync initiative data daily/periodically with JIRA updates
4. The system must validate that all initiative-related issues exist in the local database

### Initiative Management
5. The system must allow administrators to create initiatives with custom names and descriptions
6. The system must support adding multiple project + label combinations to a single initiative (e.g., "EC + label:SO" and "OD + label:x")
7. The system must support epic-based grouping within initiatives
8. The system must allow administrators to edit existing initiative configurations
9. The system must mark initiatives as ongoing (no end dates required)

### Access Control
10. The system must provide an admin interface to assign initiative access to users
11. The system must restrict client users to view only their assigned initiatives
12. The system must allow internal managers to access multiple initiatives based on their role
13. The system must provide read-only access for client users (no editing capabilities)

### Reporting & Analytics
14. The system must display total hours per month for each initiative
15. The system must calculate and display total development costs based on configurable hourly rates
16. The system must show a breakdown of hours by time period (monthly view)
17. The system must list all issues that contributed to the initiative with their respective hours
18. The system must provide real-time initiative metrics on the dashboard

### Export Functionality
19. The system must generate Excel exports containing total hours breakdown by month
20. The system must include a detailed list of contributing issues in exports
21. The system must include cost calculations in exports (if user has cost visibility permissions)
22. The system must allow users to export data for custom date ranges

### User Interface
23. The system must provide a dedicated initiatives dashboard for client users
24. The system must display initiative metrics in an intuitive, client-friendly format
25. The system must provide administrative interface for initiative management
26. The system must integrate initiative access into the existing user management system

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Client Initiative Creation**: Clients cannot create or modify initiatives themselves
2. **Real-time Sync**: Real-time JIRA synchronization is not required (daily sync is sufficient)
3. **Time Tracking Integration**: Direct time entry through the initiatives interface
4. **Budget Management**: Budget limits, alerts, or approval workflows
5. **Invoice Generation**: Formal invoice creation (export data can be used for external invoicing)
6. **Multi-Currency Support**: All costs displayed in a single currency
7. **Advanced Analytics**: Complex reporting beyond hours and costs (e.g., velocity, burndown charts)

## Design Considerations

- **Responsive Design**: Initiative dashboards must work on desktop and mobile devices
- **Performance**: Reports should load within 3 seconds for typical data volumes
- **Scalability**: Support for 100+ initiatives and 10,000+ issues per initiative
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines for client-facing interfaces
- **Consistency**: Match existing application design patterns and branding

## Technical Considerations

- **Database Schema**: Extend existing JIRA models to include labels and epic relationships
- **Initiative Model**: Create flexible many-to-many relationships between initiatives and project/label combinations
- **Caching**: Implement caching for initiative calculations to improve performance
- **Background Processing**: Use queue jobs for initiative data recalculation
- **API Integration**: Extend existing JIRA API service to fetch labels and epic data
- **Security**: Implement row-level security for initiative data access

## Success Metrics

1. **User Adoption**: 90% of designated client users actively use initiative reporting within 30 days
2. **Data Accuracy**: 99.5% accuracy in worklog-to-initiative mapping (verified through spot checks)
3. **Performance**: Initiative dashboard loads in under 3 seconds for 95% of requests
4. **Export Usage**: 70% of client users export reports at least monthly
5. **Cost Transparency**: 100% of initiatives have configured hourly rates within 14 days of launch
6. **Access Control**: Zero unauthorized access incidents in first 90 days

## Open Questions

1. **Cost Rate Configuration**: Should hourly rates be global, per-initiative, or per-user-role within initiatives?
2. **Epic Hierarchy**: How should nested epics be handled in initiative grouping?
3. **Label Changes**: When JIRA issue labels change, how should historical initiative data be handled?
4. **Initiative Overlap**: How should the system handle issues that could belong to multiple initiatives?
5. **Notification System**: Should clients receive notifications when new data is available for their initiatives?
6. **Data Retention**: How long should detailed initiative data be retained for performance optimization?
