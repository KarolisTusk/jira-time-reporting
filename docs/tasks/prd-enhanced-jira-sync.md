## Introduction/Overview

The Enhanced JIRA Synchronization System is a comprehensive data synchronization feature that will provide advanced controls for importing JIRA issues and worklogs into the reporting application. This feature addresses the need for accurate, complete, and automated time tracking data collection while providing detailed visibility into the sync process.

The primary goal is to ensure 100% coverage of all logged hours from JIRA (currently 119,033.02 hours) with no gaps or duplicates, enabling project managers to generate accurate monthly reports and allowing client users to access their project data seamlessly.

## Goals

1. **Complete Data Coverage**: Ensure all JIRA worklogs are synchronized with zero data loss or duplication
2. **Automated Maintenance**: Implement daily incremental syncs to keep data current without manual intervention
3. **Flexible Manual Control**: Provide project managers with granular control over sync operations via date ranges and project selection
4. **Transparent Operations**: Offer real-time progress tracking and comprehensive error reporting
5. **Data Integrity**: Maintain JIRA as the single source of truth with automatic conflict resolution
6. **User Experience**: Provide intuitive interfaces for both admin and client users with appropriate access controls

## User Stories

### Project Manager Stories
- As a project manager, I want to trigger a comprehensive manual sync with specific date ranges and project selection so that I can ensure complete data coverage for reporting periods
- As a project manager, I want to see real-time progress of sync operations including issues processed, worklogs imported, and any failures so that I can monitor data quality
- As a project manager, I want to receive notifications about sync failures and system status so that I can address issues promptly
- As a project manager, I want to export monthly reports in CSV format with resource type breakdowns so that I can send professional reports to stakeholders
- As a project manager, I want to validate that total imported hours match expected values so that I can ensure data accuracy

### Client User Stories

- As a client user, I want to export my project reports in CSV format so that I can use the data for my own analysis
- As a client user, I want to access reports through quick filters (last 7 days, last 30 days, specific months) so that I can quickly find relevant data

### System Stories
- As a system, I want to automatically perform daily incremental syncs so that data remains current without manual intervention
- As a system, I want to track the last sync timestamp per project so that I can optimize sync operations and avoid data gaps
- As a system, I want to respect JIRA API rate limits so that I don't impact other integrations or get blocked

## Functional Requirements

### Core Sync Engine
1. **Manual Sync Controls**: The system must provide a dedicated admin page for manual sync operations with date range picker and multi-project selection
2. **Incremental Sync Logic**: The system must track last sync timestamps per project and only sync worklogs updated after the last successful sync
3. **Automated Daily Sync**: The system must perform automated daily incremental syncs for all configured projects
4. **Checkpoint System**: The system must implement checkpoints during sync operations to enable recovery from partial failures
5. **Data Conflict Resolution**: The system must use JIRA as the source of truth, updating local data to match JIRA changes and deleting local records for deleted JIRA items

### User Interface & Progress Tracking
6. **Real-time Progress Display**: The system must show live progress updates including overall percentage, current action, issues processed count, and worklogs imported
7. **Process Breakdown**: The system must display detailed action breakdown showing current sync phase and processing status
8. **Navigation Persistence**: Users must be able to navigate away from the sync page and return to see updated progress without losing context
9. **Toggle Controls**: The system must provide a toggle to control whether to import only issues with logged hours or all issues
10. **Quick Date Filters**: The system must provide preset filters for last 7 days, last 30 days, and month selection

### Metrics & Monitoring
11. **Overall Metrics Dashboard**: The system must display total issues synced, total hours logged, total projects processed, and sync history
12. **Failed Issues Tracking**: The system must maintain a dedicated section showing failed issues with error details and retry options
13. **Data Validation**: The system must provide validation reports comparing total hours before/after sync operations
14. **Sync History**: The system must maintain detailed logs of all sync operations with timestamps, duration, and results

### Reporting & Export
15. **CSV Export**: The system must provide CSV export functionality for monthly reports including project name, month, total hours, and resource type breakdown
16. **Resource Type Classification**: The system must categorize hours by resource type (frontend, backend, management, QA, content management, devops, architect) with 'development' as default
17. **Professional Formatting**: Exported reports must have professional formatting suitable for client presentation
18. **Client Access**: Client users must have read-only access to their project reports with export capabilities

### API Integration & Performance
19. **Rate Limit Compliance**: The system must implement intelligent throttling to respect JIRA API rate limits as per official documentation
20. **Batch Processing**: The system must process issues in batches to optimize performance and memory usage
21. **Error Handling**: The system must gracefully handle API errors, network issues, and data conflicts with appropriate user feedback
22. **Performance Optimization**: Sync operations must complete within reasonable timeframes (target: under 30 minutes for typical monthly sync)

### Access Control & Security
23. **Admin Access**: Only users with admin/project manager roles must have access to the sync functionality page
24. **Client User Restrictions**: Client users must not have access to sync controls but can view and export their project reports
25. **Data Security**: All JIRA API credentials must remain encrypted and secure during sync operations

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **JIRA Write Operations**: This system will not write any data back to JIRA - it is read-only
2. **New Project Creation**: The system will not create new JIRA project records - it works with existing configured projects
3. **Custom User Management**: No changes to the existing user role system beyond the current admin/client distinction
4. **Advanced Report Formats**: Initially only CSV export - PDF, Excel, and other formats are future enhancements
5. **Real-time JIRA Webhooks**: Initial version uses polling-based sync - webhook integration is a future enhancement
6. **Custom Resource Type Management**: Resource types are predefined categories - custom type creation is out of scope

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Dedicated Admin Page**: Create a new "Advanced Sync" page accessible only to admin users
- **Progress Visualization**: Use progress bars, status indicators, and real-time counters for sync operations
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the interface works on both desktop and tablet devices
- **Toast Notifications**: Implement toast notifications for sync completion, failures, and important status updates
- **Loading States**: Provide clear loading states and skeleton screens during data fetching

### Component Integration
- **Existing UI Framework**: Use the established Reka UI components and Tailwind CSS styling
- **Vue.js Components**: Create reusable Vue components for sync controls, progress tracking, and metrics display
- **Consistent Navigation**: Integrate with the existing sidebar navigation system

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema
- **Sync Timestamps**: Extend existing sync history tables to track per-project last sync timestamps
- **Checkpoint Data**: Store sync checkpoint information for recovery purposes
- **Failed Operations**: Maintain detailed records of failed sync operations for debugging

### Queue System Integration
- **Background Processing**: Leverage existing Laravel queue system for sync operations
- **Job Priorities**: Implement job priorities to ensure manual syncs take precedence over automated ones
- **Progress Broadcasting**: Use existing broadcasting system for real-time progress updates

### API Integration
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff and request queuing to respect JIRA API limits
- **Batch Optimization**: Use JIRA's batch API endpoints where available to reduce request count
- **Error Recovery**: Implement retry logic with intelligent backoff for transient failures

### Performance Targets
- **Memory Usage**: Limit memory usage to under 512MB during sync operations
- **Sync Duration**: Target completion times of under 30 minutes for monthly syncs of typical projects
- **Database Performance**: Optimize database queries to handle large datasets efficiently

## Success Metrics

### Data Accuracy Metrics
1. **Total Hours Validation**: Imported total hours must match JIRA baseline (currently 119,033.02 hours)
2. **Monthly Hours Verification**: Monthly totals must match expected values (May 2025: 2731.23 hours, April 2025: 2967.63 hours)
3. **Zero Data Loss**: No worklogs should be missed during sync operations
4. **Zero Duplication**: No duplicate worklog entries should be created

### Performance Metrics
5. **Sync Completion Rate**: 99% of automated daily syncs should complete successfully
6. **Error Recovery**: 95% of failed syncs should be recoverable through retry mechanisms
7. **API Compliance**: Zero API rate limit violations during normal operations
8. **User Experience**: Sync progress should update within 5 seconds of actual progress

### User Adoption Metrics
9. **Admin Usage**: Project managers should successfully use manual sync features within first week
10. **Client Satisfaction**: Client users should be able to access and export their reports without assistance
11. **Report Accuracy**: Exported reports should require no manual corrections or adjustments

## Open Questions

1. **Sync Scheduling**: Should there be flexibility in automated sync timing (e.g., different times for different projects) or is a single daily schedule sufficient?

2. **Historical Data**: For the initial implementation, should we focus on syncing recent data first or prioritize complete historical coverage?

3. **Notification Preferences**: Should sync notifications be configurable per user, or use a system-wide default?

4. **Resource Type Detection**: Should the system attempt to auto-detect resource types based on JIRA user roles/groups, or rely on manual configuration?

5. **Sync Conflicts**: In cases where local data has been manually modified, should the system prompt for user decision or automatically overwrite with JIRA data?
